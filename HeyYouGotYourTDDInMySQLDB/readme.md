# *Hey, You Got Your TDD in My SQL DB!*

This directory contains slides from the *Hey, You Got Your TDD In My SQL DB* session at [CodeMash 2020](http://www.codemash.org/) by [Jeff McKenzie](http://www.codemash.org/speaker-details/?id=b912632d-9770-4a0c-a028-9ec5c9a2e023) on January 10, 2020.

Please refer to the [sql-tdd](https://github.com/mcknz/sql-tdd) repository for instructions on creating and running the [tSQLt](https://tsqlt.org/) tests as shown in the [presentation](HeyYouGotYourTDDInMySQLDB_JeffMcKenzie_CodeMash2020_2020-01-10.pdf):

## CodeMash
CodeMash is a unique event that educates developers on current practices, methodologies and technology trends in variety of platforms and development languages such as Java, .NET, Ruby and PHP. Held every January at the lush Kalahari Resort in Sandusky, Ohio, attendees will be able to attend a world-class technical conference amid Ohioâ€™s largest indoor waterpark.

## Abstract
When should we test our data? From an application development perspective, a unit test against a database isn't a unit test at all. Which makes sense -- connected systems introduce overhead and dependency, both of which reduce stability and decrease productivity during test-driven development (TDD). But if we wait for integration testing, critical functionality can get missed. In this session, we will discuss strategies for filling the data testing gap, directly within a Microsoft SQL Server environment. If you do a lot of work in T-SQL but aren't familiar with TDD, you'll learn the why and how of test-first development. If you're accomplished with unit tests, but never tried them in your database, you'll learn how to apply familiar concepts like setup, mocking, and assertion. We'll spend most of our time walking through a solution based on a real-world project, specifically using the open source tSQLt database unit testing framework.

## Bio
Jeff McKenzie has worked in software development for nearly twenty years, in both freelance and full-time capacities, as a developer and team leader. He enjoys helping others solve problems through technology, whether it's the small business getting on the web for the first time, or a Fortune 500 company expanding its enterprise. Although he started his career using BASIC on an Atari 800, he took a big detour, getting Biology and English degrees before rediscovering programming, with a new thing called the World Wide Web. He is currently Architect at Insight Digital Innovation (formerly Cardinal Solutions) in Columbus Ohio.
